Earth---Beyond-server
=====================

Earth and Beyond server-side code, dev tools, content DB.

The server itself was designed to run on Windows. There is a linux trunk, but it may or may not work. Feel free to re-write it from the ground up. The windows server works, but you'll need to run it in debug mode as it still crashes fairly frequently.

A copy of the content DB needed to make the server work (quests, sector info, mobs, drops, items, etc) is included. MySQL is the DB this is designed to work with. Also, various tools, mostly written in C#, are included for editing the database (sector editor, mob editor, etc).

This is mostly for fans of Earth and Beyond who want to have somewhere to replay their favorite parts of their beloved game.
