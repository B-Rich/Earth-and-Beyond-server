To use the SQL database, download the server and tools from the following links.

SERVER: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html
TOOLS:  http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html

Install the server and then use the Administrator tool to log in, and restore the
database from the .sql file. Then populate account data in `net7_accounts` and
everything is good to go.
